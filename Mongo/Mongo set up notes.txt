# pull mongon docker image  from here
docker pull mongo

# run docker with mapped port 5174 from here:
docker run --name mscmongo --restart=always -d -p 5174:27017 mongo mongod --auth

# enter docker like so:
sudo docker exec -i -t mscmongo bash

# then follow thse instructions: https://gist.github.com/davideicardi/f2094c4c3f3e00fbd490

# get ip like this: 
docker inspect 55af60b26b5a | grep '"IPAddress"' | head -n 1

# see if it worked here (NB this worked for me but there is a pitfall and you may need to enter the ip): http://localhost:5174

# you should see: It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port.
